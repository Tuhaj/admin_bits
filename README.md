## Installation

Install the latest stable release:

  [sudo] gem install admin_bits
```

In Rails, add it to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'admin_bits'
```

Finally, restart the server to apply the changes.

## Getting Started
We recommend to use admin_bits generator.
```
  rails generate admin_bits items [options]
```

this should add route `admin/items` and give you files:
```
  lib/admin/item_resource.rb
  app/controllers/admin/base_controller.rb
  app/controllers/admin/items_controller.rb
  app/views/layouts/admin.html.erb
```

If you want to learn more about the generator check its [documentation](https://github.com/wilqq/admin_bits/wiki/Generator).

Check out your `item_resource` class for some hints on how you can customize your Resource. This class contain settings associated with the items resource. You can also check [documentation](https://github.com/wilqq/admin_bits/wiki/Resource-class) for more information.

You will find `resource` private method in resource items_controller.

```ruby
def resource
  @resource ||= Admin::ItemResource.new(params)
end
```

You can use this for example in your index action:

```ruby
def index
  @items = resource.fetch_for_index
end
```
