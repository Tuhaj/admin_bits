## Installation

Install the latest stable release:
```
  gem install admin_bits
```

In Rails, add it to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'admin_bits'
```

Finally, restart the server to apply the changes.

## Getting Started
The easiest way to get started is to user admin_bits generator.

Let's assume that you have model `Item`. The following command will create a new `Admin::ItemsController` with initial resource:

```
  rails generate admin_bits items
```

The resource, layout and assets can be freely modified. If there were no errors, one should be able to see new route `admin/items`.

Some new files should have appeared, like:
```
  app/models/admin/item_resource.rb
  app/controllers/admin/base_controller.rb
  app/controllers/admin/items_controller.rb
  app/views/layouts/admin.html.erb
```

If you want to learn more about the generator check its [documentation](https://github.com/wilqq/admin_bits/wiki/Generator).

Check out your `item_resource` class for some hints on how you can customize your Resource. This class contain settings associated with the items resource. You can also check [documentation](https://github.com/wilqq/admin_bits/wiki/Resource-class) for more information.

You will find `resource` private method in resource items_controller.

```ruby
def resource
  @resource ||= Admin::ItemResource.new(params)
end
```

You can use this for example in your index action:

```ruby
def index
  @items = resource.fetch_for_index
end
```
